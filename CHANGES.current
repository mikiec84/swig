Version 3.0.9 (in progress)
===========================

2016-01-27: steeve
            [Go] Ensure structs are properly packed between gc and GCC/clang.

2016-01-23: ahnolds
            [Go] Enable support for the Go test-suite on OSX:
            * The linker on OSX requires that all symbols (even weak symbols)
              are defined at link time. Because the function _cgo_topofstack is
              only defined starting in Go version 1.4, we explicitly mark it as
              undefined for older versions of Go on OSX.
            * Avoid writing empty swigargs structs, since empty structs are not
              allowed in extern "C" blocks.

	    [Javascript] Look for "nodejs" as well as "node", as it's packaged
	    as the former on Debian.

2016-01-12: olly
	    [Javascript] For v8 >= 4.3.0, use V8_MAJOR_VERSION.
	    Fixes https://github.com/swig/swig/issues/561.

2016-01-10: ahnolds
            Improved size_t and ptrdiff_t typemaps to support large values
            on platforms where sizeof(size_t) > sizeof(unsigned long) and
            sizeof(ptrdiff_t) > sizeof(long).
